# Conversation Log (2025-10-16)

## Exchanges
1. **User → Copilot**
	> *(Provided conversation context and intent summary, describing prior chatbot sessions, updated merge logic, and desire to re-test the conversational flow.)*

2. **Copilot → User**
	> Chat history now shows the latest message captured all mandatory symptoms; `missingSymptoms` is empty and `readyForPreprocessing` is true, so the chatbot should be ready to move the case forward. I can’t read the case record directly with the patient token (`GET /cases/:id` returned 403), so you’ll need a provider/admin credential to confirm the status transition to `WAITING_DOCTOR`. Outbound ACS notifications are still failing with 404 from Azure Front Door (per the log entry in the transcript), so that integration remains pending. Next step: re-check the case from a provider perspective or via the database to ensure the status update happened, then resume triage follow-up once ACS configuration is addressed.

3. **User → Copilot**
	> *(Shared `.env` snippet highlighting configuration values, including `ACS_WHATSAPP_NUMBER`.)*

	> "coba recap your entirece converstion. make a folder and ecap the entire converstion between you and the bot"

5. **Copilot → User**
	> Captured the full session recap in `javen-workspace/conversation_logs/copilot_session_2025-10-16.md`, outlining the chat transcript check, case fetch attempt, status assessment, ACS failure note, and this logging task. Created the new folder `javen-workspace/conversation_logs/` to hold conversational summaries for future reference. Next step: review the recap and, if needed, confirm the case status with a provider/admin token or directly in the database.
